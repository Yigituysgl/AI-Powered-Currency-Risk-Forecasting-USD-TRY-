# AI-Powered-Currency-Risk-Forecasting-USD-TRY-


This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning models to forecast the USD/TRY exchange rate based on historical price trends. It is a complete, end-to-end machine learning pipeline including:

- Data cleaning & exploration
- Feature engineering
- Time-series supervised learning
- Model training using PyTorch
- Performance evaluation


Project Overview

Currency forecasting is critical for financial analysts, businesses, and treasury departments dealing with foreign exchange exposure. This project predicts future USD/TRY rates using a sequence-based LSTM model trained on 10 years of historical exchange rate data.
